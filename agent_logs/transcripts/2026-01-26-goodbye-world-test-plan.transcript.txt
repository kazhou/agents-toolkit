Assistant: I'm now in plan mode. What would you like me to help you plan? Please describe the task or feature you'd like to implement.
User: create a plan to print "hello world". we're just testing the logging functions
Assistant: Let me first look at the logging setup to understand what we're testing.
Assistant: [Tool: Read]
Assistant: I understand. This is a simple test to verify the planning logging hook works correctly. Let me create a minimal plan.
Assistant: [Tool: Write]
Assistant: Plan created. This will test the logging hook which should:
1. Rename the plan file to `2026-01-26-hello-world-test-plan.md`
2. Save a cleaned transcript to `agent_logs/transcripts/`
3. Auto-commit both files
Assistant: [Tool: ExitPlanMode]
Assistant: Plan approved. Let me execute the hello world print.
Assistant: [Tool: Bash]
Assistant: Done. Let me verify the logging hook worked by checking for the renamed files.
Assistant: [Tool: Bash]
Assistant: The logging hook worked correctly:

1. **Plan renamed**: `parallel-greeting-goblet.md` → `2026-01-26-hello-world-test-plan.md`
2. **Transcript saved**: `2026-01-26-hello-world-test-plan.transcript.txt`

Let me verify the git commit.
Assistant: [Tool: Bash]
Assistant: All logging functions working correctly:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Plan rename | ✓ `2026-01-26-hello-world-test-plan.md` |
| Transcript saved | ✓ `2026-01-26-hello-world-test-plan.transcript.txt` |
| Auto-commit | ✓ `chore: save planning session - hello-world-test-plan` |
User: now testing re-entering plan mode in the same session. create a basic plan to print "goodbye world"
Assistant: Testing re-entry into plan mode. Let me create the plan file.
Assistant: [Tool: Write]
Assistant: Plan created. This will test whether the logging hook correctly handles a second plan in the same session (should create `2026-01-26-goodbye-world-test-plan.md`).
